# CrowdChoice - Server

Welcome to the CrowdChoice server-side! This repository contains the backend code for the CrowdChoice application. Here are some details about the challenges faced during development:

## Challenges

- **Payment Integration**: Integrating a secure and seamless payment system for Pro memberships required careful consideration of transaction handling and user authentication.

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Implementing role-based access control for users, surveyors, and admins involved designing a robust system to manage permissions effectively.

- **Real-Time Data Handling**: Managing and updating real-time survey results and user interactions posed challenges in terms of data synchronization and efficiency.

- **User Authentication and Security**: Ensuring secure user authentication, including email/password and social media login, demanded a thorough approach to user data protection and privacy.

- **Feedback Mechanism**: Establishing a comprehensive feedback mechanism for surveys, including user comments and reporting, required thoughtful design to enhance user experience and maintain platform integrity.
